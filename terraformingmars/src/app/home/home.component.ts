      consists of a double-sided game board presenting two new areas of Mars.
      Elysium takes players almost to the opposite side of Mars' equator, with vast
      lowlands for oceans in the north and a dry, mineral-rich south.
      Hellas, the southern wild, includes Mars' south pole and the enormous seven-hex
      Hellas crater that just begs to become a giant lake.`
